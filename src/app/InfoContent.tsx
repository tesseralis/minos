      <p>
        A <em>polyomino</em> is a shape composed of squares joined together at
        their edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        This labyrinth shows the family tree of polyominoes up to 8 squares. Two
        polyominoes are connected if one is a <em>child</em> of anotherâ€”that is,
        if it can be created by adding a single square to the parent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each polyomino is shaded according to its symmetry and the colors of its
        parents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click/tap on a mino to highlight its parents and children. Drag to pan
        across the graph and scroll/pinch to zoom.
      </p>
    </div>
