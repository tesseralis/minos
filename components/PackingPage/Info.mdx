# Packing polyominoes

Given a set of polyominoes, such as the set of all pentominoes, it is natural to ask whether that set can be arranged to form certain patterns, such as squares or rectangles, called _packing_. Polyomino packing problems are popular and have been the basis of many puzzles and video games.

This section reprints patterns sourced from various other polyomino sites and publications.
