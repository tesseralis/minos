# Welcome to the Labyrinth.

This site is a encyclopedia and shrine to the _polyominoes_, figures made of squares joined by their edges:

<Wrapper>
  <MinoList />
</Wrapper>

Underlying their simple definition are complex and intricate shapes whose properties are still not fully known. There is no known formula for counting the number of polyominoes of a given size, and the ways that polyominoes tile and fit together are still being explored.

Polyominoes have been featured in video games such as [Tetris], to board games such as [Blokus] and [Patchwork], to pencil puzzles such as [Fillomino].

This site documents several interesting properties of polyominoes:

This site is still a work in progress, and the world of polyominoes extends far beyond. So please, enjoy, learn, and get lost in the labyrinth.

And please, watch out for the <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>mino-taur</span>.
