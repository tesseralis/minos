# Introduction

A _polyomino_ is a figure made up of squares joined by their edges:

The smallest polyomino is a _monomino_, consisting of only a single square, followed by the _domino_ with two squares. _Tetrominoes_, polyominoes with four squares, are featured in the popular video game [Tetris][tetris]. _Pentominoes_, with five squares, are the subject of many puzzles and games, such as the problem of fitting the 12 pentominoes in a [rectangular grid](/packing/5-rect).

A polyomino is _fixed_ if different rotations and reflections are considered separate. It is _one-sided_ if rotations are considered the same figure but not reflections. It is a _free polyomino_ if reflections and rotations are considered the same. Unless otherwise stated, we will consider a polyomino to be a free polyomino.

This site provides interactive explorations of several interesting properties of polyominoes:

- [symmetry](/symmetry): an explanation of the different types of symmetries a polyomino can have.
- [classes](/classes): a categorization of polyominoes based on convexity and directedness.
- [packing](/packing): fitting a set of polyominoes tightly in some container.
- [tiling](/tiling): whether a single polyomino can completely fill the plane.
- [genealogy](/genealogy): a "family tree" showing how polyominoes are built from simpler polyominoes.
