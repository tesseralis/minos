import MinoDiv from "components/MinoDiv"
import Polyomino from "mino/Polyomino"

The word formed by starting on a point of the perimeter of a polyomino and tracking the heading, adding a new letter each time the polyomino turns (for example, North, East, South, West).

By convention, the boundary word starts at the left-most point on the bottom row of the polyomino and proceeds counter-clockwise.

For example, the following polyomino:

<MinoDiv
  mino={Polyomino.of("111_100_100")}
  stroke="black"
  fill="grey"
  size={20}
/>

has the boundary word `ENWSWS`.

Polyominoes with without [punctures](/glossary/puncture) have only one boundary word, but punctured polyominoes have additional boundary words for each puncture.

Polyominoes that share the same boundary word belong in the same [class](/classes).
