import MinoDiv from "components/MinoDiv"
import Polyomino from "mino/Polyomino"

A hole in a polyomino that is completely enclosed and that you can draw a loop around by traversing cells of a polyomino.

For example, the "O" octomino has a puncture:

<MinoDiv
  mino={Polyomino.of("111_101_111")}
  stroke="black"
  fill="grey"
  size={20}
/>

while its parent has a hole but is not punctured:

<MinoDiv
  mino={Polyomino.of("111_101_110")}
  stroke="black"
  fill="grey"
  size={20}
/>
