# Tiling the plane

A polyomino _tiles the plane_ if it is possible to cover an infinite grid with copies of the polyomino such that no holes are left.

Select a polyomino to see its tiling. These tilings use an algorithm described in "[Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042704002195)" by Glenn C. Rhoads.
