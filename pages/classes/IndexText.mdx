# Special Classes of Polyominoes

While there is no known formula or [generating function] for counting the number of $n$-ominoes, there are several [restricted subclasses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X9500003F) of polyominoes that we _do_ have generating functions for. This section explains the hierarchy of these special classes and normalizes them through a system of orthogonal and diagonal directedness.

These classes and boundary words roughly identify polyominoes of similar shape (for example, "polyominoes shaped like an L"), and polyominoes within the same class share the same color on this site. They've been given descriptive names based on shapes, rather than more technical mathematical ones.
