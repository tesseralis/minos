# Directedness Classes

What are the ways that we can categorize and group polyominoes together? We could do it by [symmetry](/symmetry), but for larger sizes of polyominoes, most of them just end up being [asymmetric](/symmetry/none). We could try to classify polyominoes with similar "shapes", like "in the shape of an L". But how do we say this formally? We can classify polyominoes that are [convex](/glossary/convex) or have [holes](/glossary/hole), or are already well-studied in mathematics such as [Ferrers diagrams]. But can we find some sort of unifying thing to group them by?

There _is_ a property that gives us such a hierarchy, called _directedness_:

- [orthogonally directed](/glossary/orthogonally-directed): when all the cells of a polyomino can be reached from a root cell by going in all but one direction.
- [diagonally directed](/glossary/diagonally-directed): when all the cells of a polyomino can be reached from an anchor by going in only two orthogonal directions.

A polyomino can be directed in more than one direction, and so we can build a hierarchy based on which directions a polyomino is directed in. We use the notation $\textrm{Dir}_m^n$ if a polyomino is orthogonally directed in $m$ directions and diagonally directed in $n$ directions. If $m$ or $n = 2$, we use $^{2\textrm{t}}$ if those two directions are opposite of each other and $^{2\textrm{c}}$ if the directions are adjacent (abbreviations for "cis" and "trans" from [cis-trans isomerism]).

Diagonally directed and convex polyominoes [have been studied] extensively, but the work of creating a hierarchy of classes is my own. In particular, while we don't have a general formula or [generating function] for all the polyominoes, we have generating functions for some of these restricted classes, and I hope that my classification aids that effort.
