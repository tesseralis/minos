A _directed convex_ polyomino is one that is both [convex](/classes/convex) and [directed](/classes/directed).

For convex polyominoes, a polyomino is directed if and only if it contains one of the corners of its bounding box. Note that this is not necessarily true for nonconvex polyominoes: there exist some nonconvex polyominoes that contain a corner of their bounding box but are not directed.

Directed convex polyominoes are a sublass of [directed semiconvex polyominoes](/classes/directed-semiconvex).
