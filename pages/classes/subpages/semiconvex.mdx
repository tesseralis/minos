A fixed polyomino is _row convex_ if a horizontal line through each row only goes through one component. It is _column convex_ if a vertical line through each column goes through one component. Since this site mainly deals with free polyominoes, we will call a polyomino _semiconvex_ if it is either row convex or column convex.

A semiconvex polyomino can be thought of as a polyomino that is [semidirected](/classes/semidirected) in two opposite directions.
