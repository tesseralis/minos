A _bar graph polyomino_ is a [semiconvex](/classes/semiconvex) polyomino that contains one side of its boundary box orthogonal to its convex axis (for example, a row-convex polyomino that contains a vertical side of its bounding box). Equivalently, it is a polyomino that are [directed](/classes/directed) from two adjacent corners.

Since they are both directed and semi-convex, bar graph polyominoes are a subclass of [directed semiconvex](/classes/directed-semiconvex) polyominoes.
