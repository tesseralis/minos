A _cross_ is a polyomino that is directed from all four orthogonal directions and thus has no outside concavities. Smaller samples create a jagged plus or cross shape, hence the name. When a cross has no punctures, they are called [convex]. Convex polyominoes have a perimeter equal to their boundary box. By definition, they are [crescents](/classes/crescent).
