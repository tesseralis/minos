A _cross_ is a polyomino that is [orthogonally directed](/glossary/orthogonally-directed) from all four directions and thus has no outside concavities. Smaller samples create a jagged plus or cross shape, hence the name. When a cross has no [punctures](/glossary/puncture), they are called [convex]. Convex polyominoes have a perimeter equal to their boundary box. By definition, they are [crescents](/classes/crescent).
