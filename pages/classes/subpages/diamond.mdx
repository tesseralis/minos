A _diamond_ is a polyomino that is [orthogonally directed](/glossary/orthogonally-directed) from all four directions and thus has no outside concavities. They form a rough diamond or lozenge shape, giving them their name. When a diamond has no [punctures](/glossary/puncture), is is called [convex](/glossary/convex). Convex polyominoes have a perimeter equal to their boundary box. By definition, they are [crescents](/classes/crescent).
