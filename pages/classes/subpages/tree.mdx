A polyomino is _semidirected_ from a side if every cell in the polyomino can be reached from an anchor cell without going towards the side. For example, a polyomino is semidirected from the bottom if every cell can be reached from an anchor cell by going up, left, or right, but not down.

All other special classes can be built off this one.
