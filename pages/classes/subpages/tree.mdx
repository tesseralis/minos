A polyomino is "orthogonally directed" in a direction if every cell in the polyomino can be reached from an anchor cell without going in the opposite direction. For example, it is up-directed if all cells can be reached from an anchor cell without going down. An orthogonally directed polyomino in any direction is called a _tree_.

Note that the anchor cells are not necessarily unique. Also, trees can have "thick roots" (aka cycles) unlike graph theoretical trees.

When a tree has an internal hole, it is called a "punctured tree". Trees without internal holes, and can be represented as a single boundary string, are atomic trees. Note that polyominoes with holes made when cells touch at a corner are still atomic.

All other special classes can be built off this one, by restricting to polyominoes that are trees in two or more directions, or restricting the number of directions a polyomino can go in.
