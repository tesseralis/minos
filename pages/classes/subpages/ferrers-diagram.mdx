A _Ferrers diagram_ is a polyomino that is diagonally directed from three corners. They are named after [Ferrers diagrams][ferrers], a way to represent the partition of a number. Note that "Ferrers graphs" usually refer to these shapes without punctures. Ferrers diagrams are both [stacks](/classes/stack) and [staircases](/classes/staircase).
