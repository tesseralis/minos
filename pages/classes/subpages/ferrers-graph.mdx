A _Ferrers graph_ is a polyomino represented by a [Ferrers diagram][ferrers], a way to represent a partition of a number. It consists of a stack of rows that are left-aligned and decreasing in size. It is equivalent to a [convex polyomino](/classes/convex) that contains three of the four corners of its bounding box, which makes it both a [stack polyomino](/classes/stack) and a [staircase polyomino](/classes/staircase), since it contains both opposite and adjacent corners.
