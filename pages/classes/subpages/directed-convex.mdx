A _convex directed_ polyomino is one that is both [convex](/classes/convex) and [directed](/classes/directed). Equivalently, it is a convex polyomino that contains one corner of its bounding box. Convex directed polyominoes are a sublass of [directed semiconvex polyominoes](/classes/directed-semiconvex).
