A _range chart_ is a polyomino that is orthogonally directed from two opposite directions. They are named after statistical range charts, as an analogue to [bar charts](/classes/bar-chart).

A range chart without punctures is also called [row](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Row-ConvexPolyomino.html) or [column convex](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Column-ConvexPolyomino.html) depending the axis.
