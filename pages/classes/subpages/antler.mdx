An _antler_ is a polyomino that is [diagonally directed](/glossary/diagonally-directed), called such since they look like one of a deer's antlers.

A polyomino that is directed in a diagonal is [orthogonally directed](/glossary/orthogonally-directed) in each of the directions that make up that diagonal. Thus, an antler is a [bent tree](/classes/bent-tree). Specifically, it is a bent tree that has only one anchor cell.
