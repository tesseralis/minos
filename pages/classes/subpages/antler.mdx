A polyomino is "diagonally directed" (e.g. left and up) if there is an anchor cell in it such that all cells in the polyomino can be reached by going only in those two directions. For example, a polyomino is "directed up-right" or "directed from the bottom-left" if each cell can be reached from the bottom-left corner by only going up and right. We call directed polyominoes _antlers_ since they look like one of a deer's antlers.

Diagonally directed polyominoes are typically just called "directed" in most papers. Note that, unlike orthogonal directedness, there can only be one anchor cell for an antler.

A polyomino that is directed in a diagonal is orthogonally directed in each of the directions that make up that diagonal. For example, a "left-and-up" directed polyomino is orthogonally directed to the left and up. Thus, an antler is a [bent tree](/classes/bent-tree), specifically, a bent tree that has only one anchor cell.
