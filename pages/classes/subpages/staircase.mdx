A _staircase polyomino_ is a a polyomino that can be defined by two paths, going in two directions (say, up and right), starting from corner and ending at the opposite one. Equivalently, it is a [convex polyomino](/classes/convex) that contains two opposite corners of its bounding box. Since it is convex and contains a corner, it is necessarily a [convex directed polyomino](/classes/convex-directed).
