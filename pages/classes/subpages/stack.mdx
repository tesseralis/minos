A _stack polyomino_ is a polyomino composed of horizontal or vertical "stacks", each smaller or equal to the previous, arranged so that they do not overhang from each other. Equivalently, it is a [convex polyomino](/classes/convex) that contains two adjacent corners of its bounding box. It is a convex [bar graph polyomino](/classes/bar-graph), and since it is convex and contains a corner, it is [convex directed](/classes/convex-directed) as well.
