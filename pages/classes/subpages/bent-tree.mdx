A _predirected_ polyomino is one that is almost [directed](/classes/directed), but instead of a single anchor cell, there are multiple anchor cells along a corner such that all other cells can be reached by going just two directions.

Formally, it is a polyomino that is [semidirected](/classes/semidirected) from two adjacent sides.
