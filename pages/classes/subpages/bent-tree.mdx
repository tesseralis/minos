A _bent tree_ is a polyomino that is directed from two adjacent orthogonal directions. It's like a tree except "bent" diagonally as if it were growing on a slope. It is similar to an [antler](/classes/antler), except instead of a single anchor cell in the corner, there can be multiple anchor cells along the border.
