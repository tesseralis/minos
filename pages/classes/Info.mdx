# Special Classes of Polyominoes

Several classes of polyominoes are well-studied. This page shows the hierarchy of some of these special classes.

These classes roughly identify polyominoes of similar shape, and polyominoes within the same class share a color on this site.

Sections stacked on top of each other have a hierarchial relationship: for example, all stack polyominoes are bar graphs.

Additionally, polyominoes with equivalent boundary strings are grouped together.
