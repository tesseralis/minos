# Special Classes of Polyominoes

There is no known formula or generating function for counting the number of $n$-ominoes. However, there are several [restricted subclasses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X9500003F) of polyominoes that we _do_ have generating functions for. This page shows the hierarchy of these studied special classes and normalizes them through a system of orthogonal and diagonal directedness.

Sections stacked on top of each other have a hierarchial relationship: for example, all stack polyominoes are bar charts. Additionally, polyominoes with equivalent boundary strings are grouped together.

These classes and boundary strings roughly identify polyominoes of similar shape (for example, "polyominoes shaped like an L"), and polyominoes within the same class share the same color on this site. They've been given descriptive names based on shapes, rather than more verbose mathematical ones.
