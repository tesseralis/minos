# Special Classes of Polyominoes

There is no known formula for counting the number of $n$-ominoes. However, there are several [restricted subclasses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X9500003F) of polyominoes that we _do_ have formulas for. This page shows the hierarchy of these special classes.

Sections stacked on top of each other have a hierarchial relationship: for example, all stack polyominoes are bar graphs.

Additionally, polyominoes with equivalent boundary strings are grouped together.

These classes and boundary strings roughly identify polyominoes of similar shape (for example, "polyominoes shaped like an L"), and polyominoes within the same class share a similar hue on this site.
