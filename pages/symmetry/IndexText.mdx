# Symmetries and Transformations

A polyomino can be _transformed_, by flipping it across an axis or diagonal, or rotating it a multiple of 90Â°. When a transformation returns an identical polyomino to what we started with, we say that the polyomino is _symmetric_. This section describes the possible types of symmetries that a polyomino can have.

Polyominoes whose symmetries are considered seperately, they are called [fixed polyominoes](/glossary/fixed). When rotations are considered the same polyomino, but not reflections, they are called [one-sided polyominoes](/glossary/one-sided). When all transformations are counted as the same polyomino, they are called [free polyominoes](/glossary/free). We usually want to deal with free polyominoes, but fixed polyominoes are easier to count. Understanding symmetries helps us convert from fixed to free polyominoes.
