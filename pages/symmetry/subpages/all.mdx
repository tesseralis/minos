A polyomino has _all symmetries of the square_ or _full symmetry_ if it is equal to its reflection over any [axis](/symmetry/axis2) or [diagonal line](/symmetry/diag2), or any [90Ëš rotation](/symmetry/rot2). This symmetry is represented by the [dihedral group][dihedral] $D_4$, the [symmetry group][symgroup] of the square.
