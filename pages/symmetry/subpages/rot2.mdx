A polyomino has _four-fold rotational symmetry_ if it is identical to its 90˚ rotation. If a polyomino has this type of symmetry, also has [two-fold rotational symmetry](/symmetry/rot), since a 180˚ rotation is equal to two 90˚ rotations. This type of symmetry is represented by $C_4$, the [cyclic group][cyclic] of order 4.
