A polyomino has _reflective symmetry over both axes_ if it is identical to its reflection over both the horizontal and vertical axes. A polyomino with this type of symmetry naturally has [reflective symmetry over an axis](/symmetry/axis). It also has [two-fold rotational symmetry](/symmetry/rot), since a 180Ëš rotation is equivalent to flipping over one axis and then another. It is represented by the [Klein four group][klein].

The smallest polyomino that has this symmetry is the domino. Since the "straight" polyomino of every size is this symmetry (except for $n = 1$), this symmetry is represented in all sizes $n > 1$.
