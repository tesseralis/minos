# Packing polyominoes

Given a group of polyominoes, an interesting question to ask is whether that group can completely cover some shape, such as a rectangle. For example, the set of pentominoes can completely fill a 6 by 10 rectangle:

<PentominoPattern />

These _packing problems_ are some of the most well studied aspects of polyominoes. Using advanced algorithms, people have made beautiful patterns using large numbers of polyominoes. I've reprinted some of my favorites in this section.

export function PentominoPattern() {
  const pattern = `游린游릴游릴游릲游릲游릲游릲游릳游릳游릳
游린游릴游릴游릵游릲游릱游릱游릱游릱游릳
游린游릴游릵游릵游릵游린游릳游릳游릱游릳
游린游릱游릲游릵游린游린游린游릳游릵游릵
游린游릱游릲游릲游릴游릴游린游릳游릳游릵
游릱游릱游릱游릲游릲游릴游릴游릴游릵游릵`
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
      <Link href="/packing/5-rect" style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "500px" }}>
        <div style={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}>
          <MinoPattern pattern={pattern} />
        </div>
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}
